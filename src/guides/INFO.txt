NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION

CSS
modules.css
    css modules creates locally scoped styles (contrasted with the global css styles) 
    allows for modularity 
inline styling is slower than modules 

GENERICS
   <TGenericName> helps typing when you want to specify generic type

REACT 
learn more 
components mounting/unmounting?
how do components handle states?

NOTES ON GAMEPLAY & DESIGN
Not scientific but marginally inspired by scientific concepts. Mostly I like learning about space things so it's fun
to add formulas based on real life natural laws to create and bound the game environment. Even though these laws create 
'unrealistic' scenerios (because of the simplifications), I still found it fun to implement them in this way.

GAME 
- NO HARD FAILURE STATES - 

story framework?
    crashed colony ship, you are AI, AI purged lots of data, colonist memory wipe, farming->industry->planet orbit-> local space->solar system-> FORK

 forks?
 resets/prestige/...
    new star (copy AI and delete local AI if not deleting chance first colony becomes hostile?)
    new quadrant
    new galaxy
    new universe

gameloop?

 gather resources -> build buildings -> research? -> increase resource gathering and build options -> gather new resources -> ...loop

 science?
    new buildings
    new projects
    new efficiencies
    new game concepts (farming -> hydroponics)
    flat efficiency boosts
    world info 
      scan planet reveals resources
      resources underground? 
      scan foreign stars for reset possibilities
    research alien tech?
 
 trade?
    resources are shared per planet? planet-moon? solar system? galaxy? universe?
      perhaps research required before shared resources? (ex: before researching space transport tech you need to transport resources from moon to earth, 
      after building spaceport/elevator/mass driver/research concept... the resources of planet and moon are aggregated (no need for trade routes)
      same for solar system (ex antimatter drive), and then for galaxy (warp drive))

 combat?
  probably not? NO HARD FAILURE STATES!
  maybe influence via military might opens possibilities (military vs diplomacy)
  piracy?

 people?
    happiness?
    health?
    genetic modification?
    population? (global? per planet?system?galaxy?universal?)
