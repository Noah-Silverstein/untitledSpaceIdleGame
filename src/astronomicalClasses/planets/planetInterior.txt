1. Expanding the Concept of αFe (AlphaFe)

The paper introduces αFe as a parameter to control how much iron is retained in the mantle versus how much goes into the core. You can use this concept as a starting point but add more parameters to diversify the types of materials and processes at play:

    αFe Variants:
        αSi: This parameter could control how much silicon remains in the mantle versus being locked in the core. Higher αSi values could result in more silicate-rich crusts.
        αMg: Controls magnesium distribution. A higher αMg could mean a mantle richer in magnesium silicates like olivine and pyroxene, while lower values might result in more magnesium oxide or even perovskite phases at high pressures.
        αCa and αAl: Parameters to determine the concentration of calcium and aluminum in the mantle versus the crust. This could lead to the formation of more diverse crustal minerals, including carbonates and aluminosilicates.

2. Core-Mantle Composition Parameters

To further explore different planetary types, you could imagine cores and mantles composed of materials other than just iron and silicates:

    Exotic Core Materials:
        Sulfur-Rich Cores: Increase sulfur content in the core to create denser, more metallic planets. This could also lead to interesting surface features if volcanic activity brings sulfur to the surface.
        Carbon-Based Cores: Perhaps a planet formed around a carbon-rich environment, leading to diamond or graphite layers within the core or mantle. This could be a way to create carbon planets.
        Nickel-Dominant Cores: Instead of the typical iron-nickel mixture, consider making cores that are more nickel-heavy, which would influence the planet’s magnetic properties and density.

    Mantle Material Variations:
        Silica-Rich Mantles: Increase the amount of silicon dioxide in the mantle, leading to crusts that are more quartz-rich. This could suggest a planet with less volcanic activity but higher tectonic complexity.
        Metal-Rich Mantles: Increase the presence of metals like copper, zinc, or even rare earth elements in the mantle. This could lead to unique mining opportunities and perhaps unique biogeochemical cycles for life.
        Sulfuric Mantles: Higher sulfur content could lead to crusts rich in sulfates and sulfides, suggesting a planet with active volcanic or hydrothermal systems.

3. Introduce a Crust-Mantle Interaction Parameter

    Crust-Mantle Mixing: Implement a parameter that determines how much material from the mantle is cycled into the crust. Planets with more active geology (e.g., subduction, rifting) would have more interaction, leading to more varied crustal minerals.
    Mantle Plumes: This could be a parameter that increases the diversity of minerals in the crust by bringing deeper mantle materials to the surface through mantle plumes (similar to Earth's hotspot volcanism, like the Hawaiian islands).

4. Differentiate Mineral Groups by Geological Processes

Use the existing mineral groups you mentioned (e.g., silicates, oxides, sulfates) and link them to specific planetary formation or evolution processes. Here are a few examples:

    Silicates: Linked to standard mantle and crustal rock formation. Higher silicate content might indicate a planet that formed further from the star, where silicates could condense out of the protoplanetary disk.
    Oxides: Increase oxide formation by introducing oxygen-rich environments, either from the atmosphere or by including more oxidizing processes in the crust and mantle.
    Carbonates: Planets with significant water-CO₂ interaction could have carbonate-rich crusts, similar to limestone formations on Earth.
    Sulfates and Sulfides: These could be tied to volcanic outgassing and hydrothermal processes. Planets with active volcanism or interaction with water could see an increase in sulfates, while sulfides could be more common in reducing (low oxygen) environments.
    Phosphates: Typically tied to biological activity, but also could be present due to specific types of crustal or hydrothermal processes.

5. Creative Geological Parameters

Introduce new parameters that aren’t strictly based on known science but can be justified through creative extrapolation:

    Planetary Cooling Rate: Faster cooling could lead to more solidified, denser crusts with fewer volcanic features, while slower cooling might lead to more diverse surface minerals due to ongoing volcanic and tectonic activity.
    Crystallization Rate: This can determine the size and purity of minerals formed in the crust. Fast crystallization leads to finer-grained minerals, while slower rates could result in larger, more distinct crystals. For example, pegmatites on Earth form large, pure crystals when crystallization is slow.
    Atmospheric Influence: Tie the crustal composition to the atmospheric composition. For example, a planet with a CO₂-rich atmosphere could see more carbonates, while one with sulfur-rich gases might see more sulfates or even metallic sulfides near the surface.

6. Planetary Geological History

    Ancient Crust: If the crust has remained stable over billions of years, it might resemble Earth’s continental crust—granite and other silicates that have been recycled through tectonic processes.
    Young Crust: A younger crust might have more basaltic compositions if it formed recently from volcanic activity.
    Metal-Rich Asteroid Bombardment: Planets that have undergone heavy bombardment from metal-rich asteroids might have a more diverse range of native elements and oxides in their crust.

Example of a More Dynamic Crust Generation System

    Base Crust Composition:
        Start with typical silicate minerals (e.g., feldspar, quartz) as the base.
        Adjust based on αFe, αMg, and αSi to control the levels of specific silicates and oxides.

    Geological Processes:
        Volcanic Activity: If high, increase basaltic silicates, oxides, and sulfates.
        Weathering: Increase carbonates and oxides if significant atmospheric interaction is present.
        Hydrothermal Activity: Raise the levels of sulfides, native elements, and unique minerals like zeolites.

    Atmospheric and Cooling Effects:
        Use the planet’s cooling rate and atmospheric composition to determine secondary minerals like carbonates or halides.
        Planets with CO₂-heavy atmospheres could see an increase in carbonates (calcite, dolomite), while sulfur-heavy planets could favor sulfates (gypsum) or sulfides (pyrite).

Conclusion

These suggestions provide a framework that is grounded in scientific principles but allows for creative flexibility. By defining parameters like αFe, planetary cooling rate, volcanic activity, and atmospheric influence, you can dynamically generate unique planetary crusts that feel realistic but allow for diverse and interesting gameplay. This approach will give you the best of both worlds: a scientifically inspired system that can still surprise players with imaginative, otherworldly planets.
